# Who Am I ? üë®‚Äçüíª

## Switchfully's Interview App
With the aim of presenting myself in an original way, I've created a basic application where I answer potential questions to help others get to know me betterüßê. This has allowed me to prepare the interview with enthusiasm while showcasing my knowledge in JAVA.




## Description

My Application is a web application built with Spring Boot that provides an API for retrieving data (Q/R). It also includes a web interface to interact with the API.

## Installation

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Guillaume1060/whoAmI.git`
2. Navigate to the API directory: `cd whoAmI/api`
3. Build the API : `mvn clean install`
4. Run the API: `java -jar .\target\api-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`
5. Navigate to the webapp directory: `cd whoAmI/webapp`
3. Build the webapp : `mvn clean install`
4. Run the webapp: `java -jar target/my-awesome-app.jar`

Make sure you have [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) installed.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can access the web interface at [http://localhost:9001](http://localhost:9001). The API endpoints are available at [http://localhost:9000/api/v1/questions](http://localhost:9000/api/v1/questions).

### Pending things to do/Bugs to fix :
- Character encoding issue with the JAR file
- SQL insert into didn't work with JAVA 17 ü§î
